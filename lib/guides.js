## How to Copy a Base Layout in Clash of Clans

Copying base layouts in Clash of Clans is easy when you have a copy link. Follow these simple steps to import any base design directly into your game.

### Method 1: Using Copy Links (Recommended)

1. **Find a Base You Like**
   - Browse our collection of bases for your Town Hall level
   - Each base has a "Copy Base" button

2. **Copy the Link**
   - Click the "Copy Base" button
   - The link is now in your clipboard

3. **Open Clash of Clans**
   - Launch the game on your device
   - Make sure you're connected to the internet

4. **Go to Base Editor**
   - Tap on your Town Hall
   - Select "Edit Layout"
   - Or tap the "i" button and choose "Layout Editor"

5. **Create New Layout**
   - Tap the layout icon (grid icon)
   - Select an empty slot or "New Layout"
   - A popup will appear asking to import from clipboard

6. **Import the Base**
   - Tap "Paste" or "Import"
   - The base layout will be imported automatically
   - Save your new layout

### Tips for Copying Bases

- **Check Your TH Level**: Make sure the base is for your Town Hall level
- **Update Buildings**: Newly copied bases may need building adjustments
- **Test in Friendly**: Try your new base in friendly challenges first
- **Keep Multiple Layouts**: Save different bases for war, farming, and trophy pushing

### Common Issues

**"Cannot Import" Error**
- The base might be for a different TH level
- Try recopying the link
- Make sure you're online

**Missing Buildings**
- Some buildings from higher TH levels won't appear
- Add any missing buildings manually

### Why Use Copy Links?

- **Save Time**: No manual building placement
- **Pro Designs**: Use bases designed by experienced players
- **Easy Updates**: Quickly switch to new meta bases
- **Share with Clan**: Help your clanmates with good bases

## CWL Base Building Tips

In Clan War Leagues, preventing 3-stars is crucial. Here's how to build bases that frustrate attackers.

### Core Principles of Anti-3 Star Bases

#### 1. Spread Key Defenses
- Don't cluster Inferno Towers
- Spread Eagle Artillery from Town Hall
- Separate X-Bows across the base

#### 2. Protect the Town Hall
- TH in center or offset center
- Surrounded by high HP buildings
- Multiple layers of walls

#### 3. Trap Placement
- Giant Bombs between defenses
- Seeking Air Mines near air targeting defenses
- Spring Traps in likely Hog paths

### Base Design Patterns

#### Ring Bases
- Forces troops around the core
- Good against Hog/Miner attacks
- Weakness: Root Riders

#### Island Bases
- Key defenses on separate compartments
- Forces spell usage to reach core
- Good against ground attacks

#### Anti-3 Compartments
- Many small compartments
- Each compartment has 1-2 defenses
- Slows down any attack

### TH-Specific Tips

**TH14-15:**
- Protect Giga Inferno
- Spread Scattershots
- Use Poison Tower strategically

**TH16-18:**
- Protect Multi-Archer Tower
- Spread Monolith effects
- Offset Town Hall

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ Clustering Infernos
2. ❌ Exposed Eagle Artillery
3. ❌ Predictable trap placement
4. ❌ All defenses in core
5. ❌ Weak outer compartments

### Testing Your Base

- Always test in Friendly Challenges
- Ask clan mates to attack
- Watch replays for weaknesses
- Update based on meta changes

## Farming Base vs War Base: What's the Difference?

Understanding when to use each base type is essential for Clash of Clans success.

### Farming Base

**Purpose:** Protect your resources (Gold, Elixir, Dark Elixir)

**Key Features:**
- Storages spread out
- Town Hall often exposed
- Collectors inside walls
- Focuses on protecting loot

**When to Use:**
- Active farming sessions
- When saving for upgrades
- Not in active wars
- Normal multiplayer battles

**Design Tips:**
- Put storages in different compartments
- Protect Dark Elixir most heavily
- Town Hall can be outside (shield farming)
- Strong splash damage coverage

### War Base

**Purpose:** Prevent stars, especially 3-stars

**Key Features:**
- Town Hall centralized
- Anti-3 star design
- Traps focused on meta attacks
- Defenses protect each other

**When to Use:**
- Clan Wars
- Clan War Leagues (CWL)
- Trophy pushing
- Legends League

**Design Tips:**
- Town Hall always protected
- Spread key defenses
- Multiple compartments
- Unpredictable trap placement

### Quick Comparison

| Feature | Farming Base | War Base |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Town Hall | Often exposed | Always protected |
| Storages | Spread & protected | Less priority |
| Goal | Save resources | Prevent stars |
| Traps | Protect collectors | Anti-meta attacks |

### Hybrid Bases

Some players use hybrid bases that balance both:
- Town Hall moderately protected
- Storages reasonably spread
- Good for casual play

### How to Switch Bases

1. Open Layout Editor
2. Select your saved layout
3. Tap "Apply to War" or "Apply to Home"
4. Confirm the change

### Pro Tips

- Have at least 2-3 farming bases
- Have 2-3 war bases
- Update war bases with meta
- Test bases in Friendly Challenges

## Anti 3-Star Base Design Principles

Creating a base that consistently defends against 3-stars requires understanding key design principles.

### Principle 1: Time Management

Most attacks fail because they run out of time.

**Strategies:**
- Create long pathing for troops
- Multiple layers of walls
- Buildings spread to edges
- Force troops to go around, not through

### Principle 2: Spell Wasting

Make attackers waste spells on non-essential targets.

**Strategies:**
- Spread Infernos (can't rage both)
- Separate Eagle from TH
- Multi-compartment design
- Fake openings

### Principle 3: Kill Squad Failures

The kill squad (heroes + CC) often determines attack success.

**Counter Strategies:**
- Protect key defenses from kill squad entry
- Giant Bombs near likely entry points
- CC troops positioned to defend early
- Town Hall not reachable by kill squad

### Principle 4: Defense Synergy

Defenses should protect each other.

**Examples:**
- Air Defense protects Inferno from air
- Wizard Tower protects Air Defense from Loons
- X-Bow covers Wizard Tower blind spots

### Base Layout Patterns

#### The Moat
- Open ring around core
- Troops walk around
- Core defenses shred them

#### The Maze
- Many small compartments
- Unpredictable pathing
- Troops get separated

#### The Offset
- Important buildings slightly off-center
- Forces awkward spell placement
- Queen charge fails

### Testing Your Anti-3 Base

1. Share in Friendly Challenge
2. Ask best attackers to try
3. Watch every replay
4. Note what almost worked
5. Fix those weaknesses

### Common Meta Attacks to Counter

**Root Rider Smash:**
- Walls won't help
- Use Monolith and Scatter
- Spread key defenses

**Super Witch:**
- Single-target Infernos
- Air-targeting defenses near core
- Giant Bombs in likely paths

**Hydra (Hog/Miner):**
- Giant Bomb pairs
- Spread splash damage
- Kill squad compartment
